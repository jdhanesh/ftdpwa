PWA for FTD
Prerequisites:
  -Install Node
  -Install YARN - npm i -g yarn
With the above package.json file in the directory, just run the command 'yarn upgrade' which will download all the node module dependencies which will be created in the node_modules directory. (Webpack, React, React-router and many others will be installed with that command and will probably take about 10-15 minutes to download all that)
If everything is setup properly, the command 'yarn start' should start the server at localhost:8080 (default) 
The 'dist' folder is for production build which will keep updating with different version names (This can be ignored for local setup)
